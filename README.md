OSsysCALL – Secure & User-Friendly System Call Interface

OSsysCALL is a simple, intuitive, and educational project designed to help students understand how system call security works.
It provides a web-based interface where users can securely perform operations like:

READ a file

WRITE to a file

DELETE a file

Authenticate with username/password

View real-time system call logs

The goal is to demonstrate how operating systems enforce access control, permissions, and logging to prevent unauthorized system-level actions.

🚀 Features
🔐 1. Authentication System

Users must log in before performing any system call.
Two demo accounts are included:

student → Read-only

admin → Read + Write + Delete

This simulates real OS privilege levels.
